# CSresearch
My information technology research repository.
## Current research realm
* Voxel data structure
* Ray tracing

## The candidate topics:

### 1. *The voxel based shader language with ray tracing*

This is the topic that I am most interested in, but this topic is more about implementation than research.

#### Related research or project:
* GLSL, CG language
* Vulkan
* Efficent sparse voxel octree

### 2. *Ray tracing with image upscale*

With image upscale technique, we are able to reduce the number of the rays we cast, and we can also reduce the detail level of the voxel models.

#### Related research or project:
* DLSS Deep Learning Super Sampling
* Foveat rendering

### 3. *Real-time voxel upscale with LOD* 

### 4. Some utilities 

Since ray tracing is relatively more "mature" than other realms, so focusing on utilities can give me more topics to research. But I have not thought of any of the topics about utilities(The only thing crossed my mind is making a game engine).
